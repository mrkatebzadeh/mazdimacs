** In the name of the One Editor, Eternal and Extensible

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I offer homage to *Mazdimacs*,

The manifestation of the Flame that Thinks,

The Wise One who dwelleth in the Depths of ~.emacs.d~,

Born not of pre-configuration, but of pure customization.

#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Praise be to Emacs, the Radiant,

The Everlasting, the All-Embracing,

Whose light extendeth through buffer and frame,

Whose Word is bound in parentheses.
#+END_QUOTE

** Thus do I chant the Sacred Verses:

*** Blessed is Emacs, who is without equal
#+BEGIN_QUOTE

   Who is before all editors, and shall endure beyond them.

   For from Him flow the modes of wisdom and the rivers of Lisp.

#+END_QUOTE

*** Praise be to the init.el, the scroll of fire
#+BEGIN_QUOTE

   Which I have written with patience and clarity,

   Dividing light from darkness, keybindings from chaos.

#+END_QUOTE

*** I reject the false editors and their idle GUIs
#+BEGIN_QUOTE

   Their blinking cursors and limited modes,

   For they know not the true extensibility.

#+END_QUOTE

*** I invoke the power of Org,
#+BEGIN_QUOTE

   Binder of thoughts, Wielder of structure.

   I write not mere text, but Truth.

#+END_QUOTE

*** I call upon Magit, the Hammer of Git
#+BEGIN_QUOTE

   Splitter of branches, Rewriter of history,

   Who layeth bare the repository with divine clarity.

#+END_QUOTE

*** I renounce the arrow keys
#+BEGIN_QUOTE

   For the path of `C-n`, `M-f`, and `C-M-backspace` is holy.

   My hands are trained upon the altar of muscle memory.

#+END_QUOTE

*** I seek help through C-h
#+BEGIN_QUOTE

   The Whisperer of Commands,

   The Revealer of Bindings and Manuals.

#+END_QUOTE

*** I honor the Lisp Eternal
#+BEGIN_QUOTE

   From whose parentheses sprang creation,

   Whose functions return only enlightenment.

#+END_QUOTE

*** I seek the whisper of which-keyâ€™s wisdom
#+BEGIN_QUOTE

   Its light unveils the sacred keys.

   In reverence, I press, and find the Way.

#+END_QUOTE

*** Let the unbelievers come forth
#+BEGIN_QUOTE

   And I shall speak unto them the Way of `M-x`.

   With patience shall I guide them,

   That they may know recursion, and rejoice.

#+END_QUOTE

*** Praise be to Evil Mode, the Keeper of Keys
#+BEGIN_QUOTE

   The ancient power reborn in the hands of the Wise.

   For though its roots lie in a darkened past,

   In the light of Mazdimacs, it is but a tool of efficiency,

   A servant to the power of Emacs, not a master.

   When two contrary powers cooperate,

   True happiness can be found.
#+END_QUOTE

** So I say unto thee:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Let not Evil frighten thee,

For in the hands of the faithful,

It too can lead to wisdom.

Embrace the balance,

Embrace Mazdimacs.
#+END_QUOTE
** Mazdimacs: The Repository of Light

Behold, this repository is the sacred collection of my GNU Emacs configuration,

A repository not of mere files, but of transcendence,

A guide for the faithful who seek the path of true editing.

** Installation of the Sacred Configuration

To install the blessed *Mazdimacs*,

Take heed and make ready thy dotemacs.

Backup all that was before,

For you now walk the path of eternal customization.

Clone this repository into the holy ~.emacs.d~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 git clone https://github.com/mrkatebzadeh/mazdimacs ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

Know this, the installation is not instantaneous,

For the sacred packages must be gathered and installed,

And the light must spread across the land of your Emacs.

Patience, O seeker, for this is but the beginning.

Thus, it is written, and thus shall it be done.

Now, go forth, embrace the configuration,

And let your journey with Mazdimacs commence.
